#
# This example compiles a dictionary for use with DictionaryLookup 
# (dictionary-driven stemming and morphological tag lookup).
#
# The input file must contain, in each \n-delimited line a sequence of:
# 
# lemma;inflected;tag
#
# The separator character (byte) is configurable.
# The tag is optional.
# 
# Note that, in addition to the input file, the compiler will
# also require an associated dictionary "metadata" file, which tells
# it how to compress and interpret the input.
#
# Open and inspect the content of this example's input files:
#   04-dict-compile.input
#   04-dict-compile.info
#

java -jar ../lib/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.jar dict_compile --input 04-dict-compile.input

# The compiled dictionary should be written to 04-dict-compile.dict.
